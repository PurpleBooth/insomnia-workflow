## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following
things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your
contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always
> look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me
the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

  - Does it work
  - Are any new keywords suitably memorable
  - Are there descriptions on the workflow

### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository

The aim of this repository is:

  - Create a replacement for the no longer updated [Insomnia
    X](https://github.com/semaja2/InsomniaX)
  - Create a way to manage the sleep state of a mac without remembering
    complicated commands

### Does it follow the contributor covenant

This repository has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), This
repository has a code of conduct, I will remove things that do not
respect it.
